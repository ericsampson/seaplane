## What is Seaplane?

Seaplane is the global platform for building and scaling your application stack

The CLI is a simple and intuitive way to interact with our run your workloads
on the Seaplane cloud and interact with our public APIs. The CLI utilizes our
SDK internally. As such it also serves as a reference application for how our
SDK and an APIs can be utilized.

Started] guide.
